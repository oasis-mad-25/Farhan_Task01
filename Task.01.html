<P>Macaroni is a dry pasta variety which is more like a curved tube.The curved tube variety is elbow macaroni pasta which I have used here and the other variety is a narrow tube.But the most commen variety available here is the elbow macaroni.</p>
<p>I always love to include Indian flavors in pasta and this Indian style Macaroni Pasta is one of my family favorites. It is a basic onion tomato based curry made and blended with cooked pasta. This recipe is medium spicy hence suitable for kids too.
<p>I have not used cheese or cream to make it creamy and rich but if you wish you can add it, kindly check my variations section for it. I have used just our basic Indian spices like red chili powder and garam masala powder along with mixed herbs.
